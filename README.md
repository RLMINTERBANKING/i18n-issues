# i18n-issues


Are you struggling to use the Web or an eBook reader in a particular language or writing system?  Are there features you wish were available, or worked better?

If so, raise an issue here.

At the W3C we're interested in understand what's blocking the use of the Web for people around the world, so we're looking for people to let us know where their pain points are.  We'll see whether there's something we can do about it.

Relevant issues include language and writing features that we may be able to fix by changing CSS, HTML, Unicode, CLDR, or other technologies of that kind. Out of scope are issues such as broadband availability, IDN,and other societal factors.

Please raise a separate issue for each specific problem.  That will enable us to more easily handle the discussions and manage the overall problem list.
